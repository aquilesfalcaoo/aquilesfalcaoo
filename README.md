### Hi there I am Aquiles ðŸ‘‹

I'm graduating in Information Systems, and studying the Front-End development part. And now I'm looking for opportunities in the development area. I would like to be part of a company where I can have an opportunity to develop my potential. I believe that with my knowledge, skills and competences, I can also contribute to personal growth. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JQuery, SASS and Bootstrap...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Back-End...
